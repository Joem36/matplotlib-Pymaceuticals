I was able to utilize stack over flow to obtain details for code on the scatter plot, scatter plot with line and other codes.  All were used for reference in specific.  I also used stack overdlow for the groupbys and the DataFrames.  No exact lines were used in the process.  Only how to initiate the lines of code and implenting that into my data
