-Pymaceuticals Inc. Analysis
-Overview
This project analyzes the results of a drug trial conducted by Pymaceuticals Inc. to determine the effectiveness of various drug regimens in reducing tumor size in mice. The analysis focuses on four key drugs: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. The primary goal is to identify the drug regimens that effectively reduce tumor size and understand the overall impact on the mice.

Analysis Summary
Throughout the specified drug process, Capomulin and Ramicane showed the best results in diminishing tumor size, while Infubinol and Ceftamin were less effective. The analysis included several key steps:

Data Cleaning:

Merged mouse metadata and study results.
Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
Summary Statistics:

Calculated mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of tumor volumes for each drug regimen.
Visualization:

Generated bar plots to show the total number of observations for each drug regimen.
Created pie charts to display the distribution of male and female mice.
Produced box plots to visualize the distribution of tumor volumes for each treatment group.
Quartiles and Outliers:

Calculated the interquartile range (IQR) and identified potential outliers in the tumor volume data.
Line and Scatter Plots:

Generated a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.
Created a scatter plot to examine the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
Correlation and Regression Analysis:

Calculated the correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
Performed a linear regression analysis to model the relationship.
Key Findings
Capomulin and Ramicane: These drugs were most effective in reducing tumor size.
Infubinol and Ceftamin: These drugs were less effective in comparison.
Correlation Analysis: There is a strong positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen, indicating that heavier mice tended to have larger tumors.
Visualizations
Bar and Pie Charts: Provide an overview of the data distribution and demographics.
Box Plots: Highlight the effectiveness of different treatments in reducing tumor size.
Scatter Plots and Regression: Illustrate the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
Conclusion
The analysis confirms that Capomulin and Ramicane are promising treatments for reducing tumor size. Further investigation is needed to understand the factors influencing the effectiveness of Infubinol and Ceftamin.
